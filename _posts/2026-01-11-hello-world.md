Welcome to my blog! This is my first post, marking the beginning of a space where I'll share thoughts on technology, ideas, and creative pursuits.

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about topics that interest me, including:

- Software development and engineering
- Tools and workflows that boost productivity
- Lessons learned from projects and experiments

## Getting Started

This blog is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). It's a simple, fast, and reliable setup for publishing content.

Stay tuned for more posts!
